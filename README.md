# Memory Puzzle Game in Python using Pygame

## Description

This is a memory puzzle game built in Python using the Pygame library. The game presents a grid of rectangles, each concealing different shapes of various colors. The objective is to find matching pairs of shapes hidden behind the rectangles by flipping them over in as few attempts as possible.

## Features

- Grid layout with 16 rectangles hiding shapes.
- Shapes include squares, circles, triangles, and diamonds, each with distinct colors.
- Game logic for identifying matching pairs.
- Game completion message with an option to restart.
- Simple and interactive graphical user interface (GUI).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (can be installed via `pip install pygame`)

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` script using Python.
2. Memorize the shapes and their positions behind the rectangles.
3. Click on two rectangles to reveal the shapes.
4. If the shapes match, they stay revealed; otherwise, they are hidden again.
5. Continue until all pairs are matched to win the game.
